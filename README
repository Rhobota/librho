To make the library, run:

          make

That will put a bunch of object files and a static library file in 'objects/'.

You can now run the tests with the command:

          make test

If you'd like to install the header files and the static lib permanently, run:

          make install

That will put stuff in '/usr/local/include' and in '/usr/local/lib'. You can
now compile your programs by passing -lrho to g++. Try it out with the
examples in 'examples/'.

To clean-up, run:

          make clean

This directory is version-controlled by Mercurial, so feel free to make changes
and commit them.

Here are a few things I'd like the library to have soon:

    - udp sockets
    - non-blocking tcp sockets
    - a thread pool
    - iSerializable
    - network queue
    - graph library
