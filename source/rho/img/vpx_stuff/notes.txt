---- libvpx.tar.gz ----
-----------------------

This code was obtained in Jan 2015 from the git repo at:

     https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libvpx

The official website for libvpx (and webm) is at:

     http://www.webmproject.org/

I have saved a snapshot of the git repo as I found it in
Jan 2015 at the following location on my computer (because
it might be useful to look at the git changelog sometime):

---- libvpx-test.tar.gz ----
----------------------------

This is a hacked-up version of libvpx.tar.gz that I made just
to play around with.

---- yasm-1.3.0.tar.gz ----
---------------------------

The libvpx library depends on this library (yasm).

---- Compiling on Windows ----
------------------------------

I was able to compile both yasm and libvpx on Windows using MSYS (a bash
emulator sort-of thing that comes with MinGW). I didn't have such success
using Cygwin, although it probably could work. Using MSYS, I could do the
normal `./configure && make && make install` on both yasm and libvpx. The
install part put the headers and the .a files into MYSYS's virtual file
system thing. I was able to copy them out of there and into whatever
other include and lib directories I needed them to be in -- eg. the Cygwin
include and lib dirs for Cygwin's MinGW port, which is what I use to
compile everything else on Windows.
